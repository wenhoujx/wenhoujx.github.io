        <p>
            I wrote my first program, a calculator, using VBA in elementary
            school. Knowing USA is the best place to pursue a programming
            career, I came here 🇺🇸 and studied computer science at UMD.

        <p>
            2022 - now, I live a small startup Claritype life, I do so many
            things that I joke about being the plumber 🔧 of the company (I
            don't do plumbing though).
